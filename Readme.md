# Css static theme & font generator

Hello and welcome to my css static theme & font generator.

I made these tools to make it easier for me to manage my css themes and font files. I got the idea for this as I was working on my ADHD Helper app project.

I was having trouble keeping track of what was where in my css files. I decided I needed a way to generate multiple css files from a single layout file. This way I could make a single change in one file and have it update all the other files. After several hours of learning scss I figured out how to create these tools.

These tools work well for me, so I made this module. I hope that you find this module useful.
You can find a demo for this module here.
